# Graphical Dictionary of Toki Pona

This dictionary is organized to assist in the reading of
Toki Pona in the *sitelen pona*
system of hieroglyphs.  The glyphs are grouped
according to their general shape to make it easier to

In order to build the PDF you would need a few tools:


  * The `lualatex` package

  * The [linja pona 4.9 font](http://musilili.net/linja-pona/) installed and integrated into *latex*.  How to do that is beyond the scope of this document.
