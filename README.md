# Graphical Dictionary of Toki Pona

This dictionary is organized to assist in the reading of Toki Pona
in the *sitelen pona* system of hieroglyphs.  The glyphs are grouped
according to their general shape to make it easier to see differences
 between similar signs.  The definitions follow.

All you really need is the `dict.pdf` file, but if you really want to
modify things and rebuild it, you would need a few tools and 
familiarity with *LaTeX*:

  * The `lualatex` package

  * The [linja pona 4.9 font](http://musilili.net/linja-pona/) installed and integrated into *LaTeX*.  How to do that is beyond the scope of this document.

Then all you need to do is issue the command:
```
    lualatex dict.tex
```
